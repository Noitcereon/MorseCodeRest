# MorseCodeRest
A tiny API to translate morse code into standard letters/numbers.


## Installation

The easiest way to get this API running is by using Visual Studio. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this git repository to your device
2. Run it with Visual Studio.

## Usage

There is currently only one endpoint: /api/translate

If you have it running locally you can access it in your browser through something like this url:

`http://localhost:62032/api/translate?morseCharacter=.`

[baseUrl]/api/translate?morseCharacter=[morseCharacterInput]
